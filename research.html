<p>Our aim is to understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying
perception. We focus on visual motion perception, because it is
relatively simple to present precisely controlled moving stimuli to a
subject. We correlate the subject's perceptual reports, or the
responses of single neurons in visual cortex, with the presented
stimulus. This gives us insights into the neuronal mechanisms that
underlie the <span style="font-style: italic;">encoding</span> of a
visual stimulus, and <span style="font-style: italic;">decoding</span>
of sensory activity to generate perception or behaviour.</p>
<h2>Techniques</h2>
<p>We employ a range of techniques including:</p>
<ul>
  <li> human psychophysics </li>
  <li> animal psychophysics </li>
  <li> extracellular recordings from single and multiple neurons </li>
  <li> eye tracking during smooth pursuit, ocular following and
saccades </li>
  <li> computational modeling </li>
</ul>
<h2>Current projects</h2>
<p>
Enquiries from potential students and postdocs are always welcome.
Experience in electrophysiology, psychophysics, computer programming or
Matlab is desirable, but enthusiasm is more important than experience.<br>

laboratory, please contact Nic Price.</p>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The
influence of stimulus history and task context on neuronal sensitivity
and perception</span>
<p>Survival requires analysing a barrage of sensory stimulation from
the environment. However, the brain cannot encode every event,
requiring strategies for efficient processing of sensory information.
By monitoring neuronal activity in animals performing behavioural
tasks, we will determine how sensory encoding in the brain depends on
stimulus history and task context. We hypothesize that neuronal
sensitivity is matched to prevailing stimuli and to the current
behavioral task, enhancing perceptual performance. This is similar to a
camera adjusting its sensitivity under different lighting. The results
of this work could be incorporated into adaptive environmental sensors
or neuro-prosthetics.</p>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
Neuronal sensitivity and variability underlying perception and action
</span>
<p>Perception
and behaviour are often unpredictable. We do not
identically perceive repeated stimuli, and even professional athletes
cannot
precisely replicate their actions. This has implications for survival,
which
demands accurate responses to a barrage of environmental stimulation.
In the
brain, sensory information is represented by patterns of electrical
activity
across populations of neurons, with unique patterns producing different
conscious
perceptions or actions. Intriguingly, neuronal responses to repeated
stimuli are highly
variable, suggesting that perceptual and behavioural variability
originates in
sensory cortex.</p>
<p>Vision is an excellent model for studying the variability in
sensory processing: in behaving animals, we can compare neuronal
responses to a
stimulus with eye movements and perceptual judgments of the stimulus.
This will
give insights into how the variable activity of neuronal populations
underlies
perception and behaviour. Importantly, deficits in motion perception
and eye
movements are associated with medical conditions including
schizophrenia,
Parkinson’s disease and dyslexia. Thus, understanding the properties of
motion-sensitive neurons and their role in oculomotor control could
improve
treatment of these conditions.</p>
<p>We will record extracellular neuronal activity in animals trained to
make perceptual judgements of the speed of a moving
stimulus, while they simultaneously make smooth tracking eye movements.
We can
compare the activity of multiple sensory neurons on each trial with the
accuracy of the animal’s judgments and eye movements. This allows us to
characterise how populations of sensory neurons with variable responses
encode
stimuli, and how this activity is decoded to generate perception and
action. We
will also examine how neuronal activity, motion perception and tracking
eye
movements are modulated by rapid, saccadic eye movements and by
localised
electrical microstimulation within sensory cortex.</p>
